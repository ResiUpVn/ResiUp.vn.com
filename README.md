## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is designed to be run in a web-based development environment like **Google's AI Studio**, which handles dependency management and environment variables.

### Prerequisites

*   An environment that provides the `@google/genai` SDK and other dependencies.
*   A Google AI API key provided as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.

The application's `index.html` uses an `importmap` to manage dependencies, so no local `npm install` is required if running in a compatible environment.
